abstract = {Training qualified human resources is a challenge in all areas of knowledge. In particular, in the areas where the training environment of the graduates is not easily laboratoryable and/or possible to emulate, internships are often used in the work context, where an On-the-Job Training is provided. Higher education all over the world has sought to innovate in the way it mixes education. Accordingly, the digital has populated teaching-learning strategies in an attempt to make teaching more universal, more ubiquitous and more personalized, without losing rigor or the necessary requirements. In this path of innovation, e-learning or b-learning mechanisms were and still are used. However, we believe that a more decisive step must be taken by incorporating Extended Reality tools to develop and evolve the way in which competences can be acquired and evaluated, both in the classroom and in home study - a new approach at the service of the teacher and of the student. In this context, this work analyzes the role of Extended Reality in Human Resources training in the hospitality sector. In addition, a conceptual model is proposed to implement the use of Extended Reality in the context of higher education in the field of hospitality, in a conceptualization approach. Finally, future work is referred concerning the validation of the model and drawn technological considerations for the model implementation.}

abstract = {Pilot training has been, for decades, aided by flight simulators with different characteristics and degrees of fidelity. However, many studies indicate that, despite the recognized contribution of simulator training, actual flying practice is still necessary, depending on the trained task. This work introduces the proposal of using augmented reality for in-flight training, where elements in the environment outside the aircraft are displayed through an augmented reality headset to create a simulation scenario. The training of basic formation flight is used as an example, as it requires flying with at least two aircraft, resulting in high operational costs and risk of collision between aircraft. In this case, the augmented reality system replaces the real leader aircraft with a projection. In order to evaluate the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of this proposal, this work presents a prototype of an augmented reality system integrated into a flight simulator to conduct an evaluation campaign. We investigate how the introduction of the augmented reality system impacts on human factors, such as stress and workload, as well as performance. Although the results obtained in a simulated environment are not equivalent to those from an in-flight campaign, the experimental campaign performed in the flight simulator provides a way of evaluating the impact on the pilot of some aspects of the proposed solution, such as the performance of occlusion routines and some ergonomic aspects of the augmented reality headset.}

    abstract = {In response to the high demand for digital learning as a surrogate for physical experiences, virtual reality (VR) is positioning itself as a tool for creating educational virtual experiences. VR technology faces a number of ethical issues, including a reduction of users’ autonomy, health problems, and privacy concerns. The use of VR and realism in education can turn out to be a double-edged sword. While realistic visualizations can promote learning for some content domains, they can hinder comprehension in others. Furthermore, the effects of realism on learning also depend on learners’ spatial abilities. Letting young children and teenagers engage in virtual educational experiences can expose them to manipulation, could lead to health issues, and may infringe on their privacy. In short, realism and virtual experiences may severely limit learners’ autonomy in a number of ways. Based on a review of the literature and considerations of emerging technologies such as generative artificial intelligence, this paper presents guidelines for the ethically sound utilization of VR and realism. By applying findings and conclusions established in the context of research on the ethics of VR to the educational utilization of this technology, I develop several suggestions that may help to avoid negative consequences of educational VR. These suggestions include the utilization of spatial ability testing, requiring virtual experiences to offer alternative paths to prevent manipulation, as well as using algorithms that deidentify the highly detailed developmental profiles that can be generated through educational VR use.}

abstract = {The concept of presence, ubiquitous in VR research, remains in infancy in tourism literature. Researchers in the field have called for empirical studies into the determinants as well as consequences of presence, particularly in commercial environments. The objective of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of VR as a tourism marketing tool through presence and emotion – an association that has been suggested in cyberpsychology studies. Using a within-subjects experiment method, 72 participants experienced computer-generated, fully synthetic virtual environments of a cruise ship. The experiences were administered via pictures, video, and VR. The findings suggest that VR is significantly more effective than traditional media in evoking positive emotional responses to the stimuli. Theoretical implications include suggestions that fully-interactive synthetic VR may be more effective than 360’ VR due to the importance of engagement as a presence determinant. Managerial implications include suggestions to focus on engagement mechanics, rather than chasing photo-realistic VR advancements, for impact on emotional response.}

    abstract={Este artículo aborda el tema de la participación de actores clave vinculados al proyecto de investigación Amón\_RA: Implementación de la realidad aumentada como herramienta para la puesta en valor y difusión del paisaje urbano histórico de barrio Amón, en San José, Costa Rica. El producto del proyecto será una aplicación móvil, con la que el visitante de barrio Amón pueda obtener, en tiempo real, información sobre las diferentes capas del paisaje urbano histórico que le rodea, permitiéndole generar un criterio del valor natural, histórico, cultural y social de este sector urbano. La entidad financiadora del proyecto fue la Vicerrectoría de Investigación y Extensión del Instituto Tecnológico de Costa Rica (TEC). El artículo responde a la pregunta, cómo los procesos participativos pueden ser un medio tanto para validar como descubrir información de un barrio y la estratificación de sus diferentes componentes urbanos a través del tiempo, con el propósito de plasmar los datos en contenido para una aplicación móvil de realidad aumentada. El tipo de investigación es cualitativa, con un enfoque constructivista donde las personas relacionadas con barrio Amón participaron como fuente primaria de información, lo que le permitió al equipo investigador descubrir datos cualitativamente significativos para poner en valor el paisaje urbano histórico. Los procesos participativos brindaron el medio para un mayor entendimiento de los significados y experiencias de las personas que habitan o permanecen en el barrio; así como para validar la información encontrada en fuentes formales. Como principal conclusión es que por el valor de la información cualitativa de parte de los agentes sociales, tales como vivencias, anécdotas y secretos como parte del contenido en la aplicación móvil, esta toma un aspecto más cercano para los usuarios. Los procesos participativos en torno a la aplicación fueron un medio para reunir y documentar información no formal que pertenece a la intimidad de las familias vecinas, que se encuentran en un momento histórico donde buscan perpetuar la memoria e identidad de barrio Amón.}
