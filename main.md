# Extended Reality

## Definition

Extended reality (XR) stands for a combination of real and virtual enviroment
technologies, that covers Aumented Reality (AR) and Mixed Reality (MR). This
technology is used to create immersive experiences for the user, by combining
real and virtual worlds. The term XR initialized when Charles Wyckoff filled a
patent in 1960 for his development. Then nowadays the term has moved to the
mainstream of videogames and medicine [@hayes-2023].

1. Augmented Reality
        AR is an enhanced version of the real physical world that is achieved
        through the use of digital visual elements, sound, or other sensory
        stimuli and delivered via technology. It is a growing trend among
        companies involved in mobile computing and business applications in
        particular.

1. Mixed Reality
        MR is the merge of real and virtual worlds to recreate and produce new
        environments and visualizations where physical and digital objects
        co-exist one with the other. This new reality is based on advancements
        in computer vision, graphical processing, display technologies, input
        systems, and cloud computing [@qianw-2023].

1. Virtual Reality
        the use of computer modeling and simulation that enables a person to
        interact with an artificial three-dimensional (3D) visual or other
        sensory environment.

## Applications

### Education

Augmented reality has been helpfull in the education field, but when it really
starts to help students and kids is when the Covid 19 begin. When teachers try
to teach students with normal methods they get borred and lose easily their
concentration, and that's when the AR comes in. When the students learn by
using interactions and uses technologies they start to get insterest in the
topics the teacher teach.

Integrating augmented reality into the learning process will be helpfull and
will bring to the students an interactive dimension that strongly resonates
with students, specially in situationes where learning occurs remotely or
through a hybrid approach. The fusion of tangible real-world and digitals
overlays nurtures an immersive learning enviroment that captivates students
attention and incentivates their interests in subjects that are being
presented.

Now knowing this, there are some ethical concerns that are associated with the
use of virtual reality in the field of education, be it school, college or
university, these include the following [@SKULMOWSKI2023100023].

1. Manipulation:
    VR can be misused to manipulate students, as the high level of realism in VR
    environments can have divergent effects depending on the spatial ability of
    students. Safeguards need to be implemented to prevent the manipulative use of
    virtual reality experiences.

1. Privacy concerns:
    Virtual reality raises privacy concerns due to the collection of a large
    amount of data, including motor and behavioral profiles. These data can be
    exploited for identity theft and personalized virtual advertising.

1. Autonomy:
    Virtual reality represents a threat to the autonomy of users, since it can
    be addictive and allow surveillance. There is a risk that users will be
    brainwashed or have a distorted view of the world. Peer pressure,
    conformity and escapism are additional risks.

1. Equal access:
    allowing children and vulnerable groups to regularly access virtual reality
    without adequate data protection rules and informed consent is ethically
    dubious.

## Gaming and Entertaiment

Nowadays, augmented reality has gained recognition due to video games and
industries that produce technology linked to the VR concept. For example, Meta
with the Oculus Quest, PlayStation with its own VR headset, and now Apple joins
the battle with the Vision Pro. All these devices have something in common:
virtual reality [@pcmag].

Have you ever thought about what you can do in a video game with augmented
reality? For example, Racing Simulation, also known as sim racing, is a very
popular term when pilots from various categories use a VR headset and a sim
racing combo to play and improve their times in games. By training in a virtual
environment, they can test things that in real life can be very expensive, such
as crashing a car, changing weather conditions, and testing different cars and
their behaviors. This helps them improve their times, and their teams, who
cover the costs of cars, fuel, tracks, etc., will not face any risks.

Another important use of Augmented Reality is entertainment. For example, using
an Oculus Quest, you can easily watch movies, series, and YouTube videos by
searching for what you want. It’s very immersive, as all you see is a big
screen with the media you’re playing. By combining this with mixed reality, you
can adjust the size of the screen and interact with other people in your
environment.

Exercise using VR is also a significant topic. In the world, there are many
different body types, for example, muscular and slim. Using a VR headset, you
can play games that involve moving around, which causes your body to stay
active and burn fat. This is important because some people don’t enjoy
traditional exercise, making it a great way to stay active and burn fat.

It’s crucial to know that you should use this kind of technology in moderation,
as it can be very addictive. It’s recommended not to use it excessively during
the day, as it can lead to eye damage and addiction.

## Healthcare

The integration of digital technologies has leading a new paradigm shift in
teaching methods, for example in augmented reality and mixed reality has a
potential to transform the medical education, why? because with this kind of
technology people can learn the procedures, surgical planning and guidance.

The review of 26 studies that used augmented reality and mixed reality in
medical education, found that VR and XR can improve in the training of
professionals in health.

One of the key strengths highlighted in the review is the versatility of AR and
MR applications across various subjects and learner types. The studies covered
diverse healthcare disciplines, such as anatomy and anesthesia, catering to
learners of different levels and specialties. These technologies offer an
interactive and immersive learning experience, enabling participants to engage
with virtual and real-world elements simultaneously. Moreover, the studies
showcased a rich diversity in research focus, ranging from introducing novel
applications to evaluating their impact on training and learning outcomes.

There are some weaknesses in the VR and XR, for example, a lot of studies
showed early versions of things without really checking how helpful they were
for learning, as well they said that using AR and MR was really good for
improvement and learning, but others didn't find clear proof of this. Because
of these mixed results, it's important to have better ways to do the research,
like using the same methods for everyone, checking lots of different aspects,
and including more people in the studies.

## Architecture and Design

In architecture design education, XR technology is used as a new representation
tool in the early design studio to enhance student engagement with their
surroundings and to allow students to experience their design project in real
scale, this can be really helpfull for the students because they can see their
model in 3d, test it and know posible erros that could occurr. This technology
can improve the students spatial ability levels in architecture design
education

XR technology can help students to understand the relationships between objects
and to formulate mental images, which are essential skills in architecture
design. Additionally, XR technology can help students to identify possible
errors in their design and to test their models in a more efficient and
cost-effective way. This can lead to better design outcomes and a more
effective learning experience for students. Overall, the use of XR technology
in architecture design education has the potential to revolutionize the way
students learn and practice design [@darwish-2023].

The versatility of this software and user interfaces harnessing extended
reality holds the potential to profoundly reshape various global industries. By
providing immersive and interactive experiences, extended reality opens up new
avenues for training, product design, entertainment, and more. For instance, in
the field of medicine, professionals can practice intricate procedures in
virtual environments before performing them in the real world, thereby
enhancing precision and reducing risks. Similarly, the tourism industry could
enable travelers to virtually explore destinations before making travel
decisions, offering a more realistic insight into what they can expect. As
these technologies continue to evolve over time, it's exciting to contemplate
how extended reality could revolutionize the way we engage with the world
around us.

## Marketing

Based on the conducted study [@YUNG2021160], virtual reality (VR) holds significant
implications for marketing tourist destinations, particularly in the
post-COVID-19 landscape. Integrating virtual reality into marketing campaigns
can prove highly advantageous for tourism companies, especially those centered
around attractions such as cruise trips. By immersing potential clients in the
cruise experience, VR can substantially enhance their inclination towards
purchasing tickets. This strategic advantage over traditional non-immersive
marketing approaches highlights the pivotal role of delivering exceptional
experiences in retaining customers. Consequently, this approach positions
brands at the forefront of the market, potentially establishing them as market
leaders or innovators.

Of course, but how can tourism companies take advantage of the full potential
of this virtual reality tool? The study suggests that the key lies in
prioritizing user engagement over mere photographic precision or sensory
stimulation. The primary goal in crafting the VR environment should be to
enable substantial user interaction, greater participation, and individual
control of experiences. This deliberate emphasis significantly impacts the
emotional response of the user, effectively fostering a greater desire to
participate in the experiences presented through virtual reality. In essence,
the emphasis should be on investing in the overall user experience rather than
just showcasing the charm or opulence of the cruise. Without a doubt, the solid
promotion of this interactive dimension is of paramount importance.

A particularly receptive demographic for targeting comprises millennials. This
group, immersed in social media and drawn to appealing visual content, holds
the potential to exert substantial influence over their peers and family
members. Their engagement with and enthusiasm for the enticing aspects of
virtual reality can effectively motivate their loved ones to partake in such
captivating experiences, such as a cruise trip. This not only offers
millennials a chance to break away from routine but also fosters quality time
for families to relish shared moments together.

## AR Museum

As virtual reality technology continues to expand its presence in the digital
realm, its remarkable potential extends to revolutionizing the cultural sector,
particularly in the realm of museums. The incorporation of augmented reality
(AR) within this industry is particularly awe-inspiring. An innovative endeavor
in this direction involves the creation of an application called ARmvoil,
designed to immerse users in a virtual museum environment. By seamlessly
integrating AR technology, this application offers users a captivating
opportunity to interact, engage, and explore an extensive collection of
historical artifacts within a confined physical space. Furthermore, a
comparative analysis between traditional museums and AR-based museums was
conducted within the framework of this article, shedding light on aspects of
workload and user preference. The study's findings in this regard can be
distilled as follows [@10064611]:

1.	Workload: The study underscores a noteworthy discrepancy in terms of
    workload between the two museum formats. Remarkably, AR-based museum’s
    exhibit a notably lower overall workload in comparison to their traditional
    counterparts. Conventional museums often entail challenges in navigation
    due to their reliance on a taxonomy system. In contrast, the AR-based
    application's approach significantly streamlines travel and content
    consumption, occupying minimal spatial considerations.

1.	Preference users: The study indicates a significant shift in user
    preference towards AR-based museums. Over 71 percent of respondents favored
    the proposed AR application over traditional museums. Impressively, the
    AR-based application garnered a high average preference score of 4.74 out
    of 5. This substantial preference underscores the growing appeal of AR
    technology in shaping the future of museum experiences

Now, some application to this technology highlights the following:

1.	Accessibility for visitors with hearing problems: AR technology implemented
    in museums can enhance inclusivity by catering to visitors with hearing
    impairments. Through features like language translations and subtitles, AR
    provides a visual avenue for accessing information. This ensures that
    individuals with hearing difficulties can engage fully with museum content,
    fostering a more enriching experience.

1.	Future adoption by interested persons, educational institutes and
    researchers: Experts predict that augmented reality will find future
    adoption among history enthusiasts, particularly those intrigued by
    fossils, paintings, statues, and various historical artifacts. This
    technology is regarded as a potent tool for enhancing the user experience,
    effectively harnessing its potential to provide an immersive and enriching
    encounter with diverse historical objects [@10064611].

## Other uses

Extended reality could also improve the lives of disabled people, for example,
despite how odd it might seem, mixed reality can help people affected by
blindness or visual impairments. In this case, the approach involves creating a
program on a device compatible with spatial sensing such as the HoloLens 2.
This program would be capable of recognizing the surroundings and providing
auditory alerts about the environment. This is especially useful for people who
depends of a white cane, as the cane helps perceive the ground but not the area
above their pelvis.

By implementing what was described before, blind individuals could gain the
ability to recognize the entire surroundings, giving them more security and
protection. Another method to achieve this is through vibrating warnings, for
example from a smartwatch that would send more intense warnings depending on
how far objects are [@9757681].

## Improving Mirror Fitness through augmented reality technology

According to [@9985796] the global fitness industry suffered significant impacts as a result of the
pandemic. In the US, numerous fitness gyms abruptly closed in mid-March 2021,
leading to substantial layoffs affecting nearly a million fitness instructors.
Prominent establishments like Gold's Gym also faced financial setbacks. Both
the local and international fitness sectors faced challenges as businesses
suspended operations, disrupting revenue streams, while fixed costs such as
rent, salaries, and operating expenses persisted. This situation led gyms to
explore bankruptcy restructuring in order to survive.

At the start of the pandemic in the winter of 2020, there was a greater
emphasis on physical activity due to its potential benefits against COVID-19.
This led to remarkable growth in the fitness industry, giving rise to new
professionally oriented home exercise methods. These ranged from platforms like
YouTube, where trainers shared videos for subscribers, to major gyms and
industry players looking for interactive and efficient alternatives to help
people with their workouts.

An exemplary case is the introduction of Cuban's MAGIC SPORT intelligent
holographic interactive system. This innovation integrates artificial
intelligence visual recognition technology and Internet of Things technology to
improve user experience and operational efficiency. According to sources in
China, the goal is to involve 435 million people in physical activities through
this initiative.

This objective is pursued by implementing AR (Augmented Reality) to improve the
Mirror Fitness system. AR technology merges virtual information with the real
world, offering users more information without disconnecting from reality. AR
integration into Mirror Fitness allows users to receive real-time visual
feedback and corrections, enhancing exercise benefits and reducing injury
risks. In addition, AR facilitates natural and immersive interaction with
virtual objects, improving the user experience and the effectiveness of the
system.

## Medical Training

Performing the first surgery is one of the most stressful experiences for a
medical student. Even the first time they enter an operating room to witness
their initial surgical intervention, it doesn’t provide the best feeling. The
issue may be that people is not familiarized with such images, which can be
shocking when seen them in real life for first time.

On the other hand, in recent years, several Virtual Reality applications have
been developed to simulate various medical activities, including those
performed in operating room. This allows, medical students to gain their first
experience before an actual surgery.

In the same context, there is a VR application called Tersus, an application
developed using Unity and the SteamVR plugin. Tersus aims to reduce anxieties
among medical students related to their medical training experiences in
operations room. Tersus VR program consist in various steps that prepare
students for surgeries, for example:

1. Disinfection process:
    the simulation begins in a hospital hallway, where students gather all the
    necessary items for the surgery, such as clothes and gloves. They then
    proceed to a washing station to get fully disinfected.

1. Operating room preparation:
    once the first step is completed, now is time to prepare the operation
    room, in order to do this, students have to move to the room without
    touching non-sterile surfaces. Once in the room, they have to answer some
    questions in a medical quiz.

1. Minor tasks:
    Following that, medical students perform minor tasks like disinfecting the part
    of the area of patient’s body that will be operated. This simulates preparatory
    washing before the medical procedure

After completing these steps, students are required to observe the surgery. The
program also provides feedback to students, highlighting their strengths and
pointing out areas for improvement, even compelling them to repeat tasks if a
mistake occurs [@9644263].

## Military pilot training and flight simulations

It is known that flight training includes two phases: simulator-training and
in-flight training. While those are commonly used methods for training new
pilots, the first phase is inefficient and the second one is excessively
expensive. The reason why the first phase is considered inefficient is because
some studies indicate that the psychology during flights and simulated flights
is different, while the second is expensive because in-flight training involves
all the costs associated to a regular flight.

On the other hand, when talking about military flight training becomes even
worse, because the second phase involves combat training that includes the use
of two aircraft and potential risks, such as mid-air collisions. This is where
Augmented Reality may be used, one aircraft can be physically present, while
the second one is displayed using this technology, replicating all the
essential aspects of regular training. This offers several advantages,
including:

1. Mitigating the risks of a real in-flight combat training.

1. educing training cost for military pilots by half, as only one aircraft is
   needed, similar to regular in-flight training.
1. Prepare pilots to various situations and show them the field where they will
   be working.

To achieve all these advantages, a specific process is employed to train pilots
using this technology. The process consists of several steps:

1. Initial Familiarization Flight: This step involves a 10-minute flight
   session, during which the pilot is guided to perform various tasks to become
   familiar with the technology
1. Training Sessions: This step involves three distinct subjects:
    1. Short autopilot guided flight.
    1. Supervised 15 minutes flight.
    1. Unsupervised 30 minutes flight [@ARJONI2023e14181].

\end{figure}

## Hospitality and hotel personnel training

Extended reality also has a significant impact on hotel and tourism industry.
Well-trained personnel are indispensable for this section. For example,
employees need to interact with customers and provide them the best services.
Additionally, because hotel industry is constantly evolving in social,
technological and economic terms, ongoing training is of great importance.

To improve hotel personnel training, XR (Extended Reality) could be employed,
here are some reasons why:

1. Through the utilization of this technology, employees can be immersed in
   various scenarios and exposed to different types of customers they may
   attend, giving them more experience and knowledge.

1. All employees are different, some of them could be fast learners, while
   others need more time to learn. Utilizing XR technologies can facilitate
   interactive and personalized learning. This way everyone can learn at their
   own pace.

1. Also, hotel personnel can be evaluated by their performance in virtual
   scenarios provided by XR, allowing hotel superiors to give employees
   different recommendations and identify areas they should improve. [@CUNHA2023634]
