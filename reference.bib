abstract = {Training qualified human resources is a challenge in all areas of knowledge. In particular, in the areas where the training environment of the graduates is not easily laboratoryable and/or possible to emulate, internships are often used in the work context, where an On-the-Job Training is provided. Higher education all over the world has sought to innovate in the way it mixes education. Accordingly, the digital has populated teaching-learning strategies in an attempt to make teaching more universal, more ubiquitous and more personalized, without losing rigor or the necessary requirements. In this path of innovation, e-learning or b-learning mechanisms were and still are used. However, we believe that a more decisive step must be taken by incorporating Extended Reality tools to develop and evolve the way in which competences can be acquired and evaluated, both in the classroom and in home study - a new approach at the service of the teacher and of the student. In this context, this work analyzes the role of Extended Reality in Human Resources training in the hospitality sector. In addition, a conceptual model is proposed to implement the use of Extended Reality in the context of higher education in the field of hospitality, in a conceptualization approach. Finally, future work is referred concerning the validation of the model and drawn technological considerations for the model implementation.}

abstract = {Pilot training has been, for decades, aided by flight simulators with different characteristics and degrees of fidelity. However, many studies indicate that, despite the recognized contribution of simulator training, actual flying practice is still necessary, depending on the trained task. This work introduces the proposal of using augmented reality for in-flight training, where elements in the environment outside the aircraft are displayed through an augmented reality headset to create a simulation scenario. The training of basic formation flight is used as an example, as it requires flying with at least two aircraft, resulting in high operational costs and risk of collision between aircraft. In this case, the augmented reality system replaces the real leader aircraft with a projection. In order to evaluate the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of this proposal, this work presents a prototype of an augmented reality system integrated into a flight simulator to conduct an evaluation campaign. We investigate how the introduction of the augmented reality system impacts on human factors, such as stress and workload, as well as performance. Although the results obtained in a simulated environment are not equivalent to those from an in-flight campaign, the experimental campaign performed in the flight simulator provides a way of evaluating the impact on the pilot of some aspects of the proposed solution, such as the performance of occlusion routines and some ergonomic aspects of the augmented reality headset.}
